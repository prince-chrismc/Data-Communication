## Theory Assignment Two

1) E-mail requires both sender and receiver mail servers to communicate directly. Further,
all communications must be made between these two servers using SMTP.
  
   i) Is it possible to allow intermediate servers as part of this communications? If so,
what are the main advantages of doing so? If no, why is that infeasible, or what
are the disadvantages of utilizing it if it was feasible?

```
It is possible, and is typical in coperate setups where outside traffic is tagged as more dangerous.
It's common to hav an external mail server which has an enhanced firewall scanning for know viruses
or malware. This mail would then be fetched by an internal mail server and made accessible within the
doamin. This has second distinct advantage whereby local email traffic is kept within the company and
reduce the internet usage of the company ( saving money ).
```
  
   ii) Considering webmail, are there any cases when SMTP between the two mail
servers can be replaced by HTTP? Explain why, or why not.

```
Contiuing with the internal/external mail server for a company. Inbound mail would be best suited for
HTTP as it's better for pulling large amounts of data at once. The internal sever could use HTTP to
fetch the inbound mail.

Heavy media content based would also be suited for HTTP implace of SMTP as there is better support for
transfering any content type instead of being restricted to ASCII
```

2) Client-Server architecture can be used for file transfer; however, it is assumed/said to be
inferior in comparison to P2P for such operations. Considering a small number of
interacting hosts that need to share files, is it true that client-server would perform badly?
Explain clearly your answer. You must indicate why the number of interacting
hosts/peers is significant in determining whether or not client-server is suitable for file
transfer.

```
Client-Server architectures are bottle-necked at the servers bandwidth. When there are very few hosts
accessing a file at any given moment such that the upload bandwidth of the server is greater than the
total download bandwidth of the client hosts; the centralized architecture will no perform worse than
a P2P distributed system.
```

3) Show, through a detailed scenario/example, why GBN protocol would fail in case the
senderâ€™s window size exceeds 2k<sup>-1</sup>, where k is the number of frame bits for the sequence
number.
Considering that the window size is set to what it is expected to be. Is there any
possibility that GBN could produce the same performance obtained by the Unrestricted
Protocol? If no, explain clearly why this is infeasible. If so, explain clearly how, or under
what conditions, GBN could produce the same performance of the Unrestricted Protocol.

4) Explain how UDP frames can end up TCP frames being delayed, theoretically,
indefinitely! If so, what would you propose as changes to UDP to mitigate this problem?
Your solution must mainly keep the advantages/purpose of UDP, while mitigating the
problem at hand.

```
UDP has no congestion control, ie it can flod the network. This is a specific feature of TCP allowing
it to throttle back how much is sent to not overwhelm the network. If UDP traffic were to flood a host
it would cause TCP to hold back sending ( potential indefinitely ).
```

5) Show, through an example, how checksum could be inconclusive of error detection (i.e.
does not guarantee that errors can be detected). In your example, assume transmitted data
is broken into 24-bit chunks by the protocol utilizing checksum. In case errors are
detected by checksum, does that fully (100%) guarantee that errors must have actually
occurred? 

6) Show through an example (sketch the scenario), how TCP uses the credit system to
ensure that a sender would not overflow a receiver. In your scenario, assume that initial
communication establishment resulted in sender (host A in general since it also behaves
as a receiver) starting with frame # 164, while the receiver (host B in general since it also
behaves as sender) starts at frame # 292. Assume that the data size of all these exchanged
frames is 100 bytes. Further, assume that at start, each of the hosts allows the other one a
credit of 200. The rest of the scenario is up to you, however, you need to show at least
one case when both of them coincidently set the credit to 0 at the same time.

7) Some may strongly argue that it is much better to use network-assisted congestion control
instead of end-to-end congestion control. Do you support such argument? Clearly explain
why or why not, and indicate the advantages of your choice over the other one.
Why does TCP use end-to-end congestion control over the Internet?

8) With VC networks, the frame does not include the receiver address. Explain clearly how
this would still work! Give a detailed scenario that explains how deliveries to the receiver
can still be obtained. Show all needed tables at the routers in support to your scenario.

9) What is CIDR? What are the main advantages of using CIDR? Are there any major
disadvantages to this technique?

10) With NAT routers, many machines over the Internet would have the same IP address!
Explain how this would still work. Explain also how a P2P non-NAT host can establish a
connection with another peer located under a NAT.
